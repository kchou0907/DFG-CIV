# Website
## Brief Summary of How the Website was Built
The majority of the website (the main [csss-ci site]<https://www.csss-ci.com/> + all of the backend) was built utilizing CodeIgniter. I'm not positive what version the website is running, but the documentation linked above seems to be accurate. Code Igniter operates on a model-view-controller framework. If you know what that means, great! Feel free to skip this next portion. If not, then here is a quick rundown (assuming you have some web dev experience).
